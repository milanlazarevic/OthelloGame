# Othello (Reversi) Game with Minimax AI

## ðŸŽ® Overview

This project is a **Python-based Othello (Reversi) game** featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Pygame** and an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI simulates future moves to make intelligent decisions and provides a challenging opponent for the player.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Fully playable Othello game against the computer
- Graphical game board rendered with **Pygame**
- Computer opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm** to decide optimal moves
- Interactive and intuitive GUI
- Adjustable AI search depth (if implemented)
- Clear and well-structured Python code

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

You can install Pygame via pip:

pip install pygame
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the source code:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/milanlazarevic/OthelloGame.git
```

3. Run the main Python file:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Adjust the bot dificulty

In the computer.py in Computer class adjust **MAX_DEPTH** and **MAX_TIME** properties

**MAX_DEPTH** is the maximum recursion depth of the minimax algorithm. By default set to **5**
**MAX_TIME** is the maximum time after which recursion will stop and return current best move. By default set to **1s**
